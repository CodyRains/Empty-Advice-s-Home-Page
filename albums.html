            <h2>Talking in Circles</h2>
            <p>Talking in Circles was the first album I ever created. It was the turning point for me as a musician.
                This album is where I found my individual style, and will forever have a special place in my
                discography.</p>

            <h2>With or Without You</h2>
            <p>With or Without You was a big turning point for me. I took a shot in the dark by releasing a song title
                "One Way Love" with a producer Pabzzz. He was kind enough to release the song with me through his label
                Vinyl Digital. One Way Love was accepted into numerous Spotify editorial playlists, and is 80,000
                streams away from 1,000,000 streams alone. With or Without You had 2 more hit singles: Used 2 and Broke
                By Definition, which both received similar treatment. This album gave me a fan base. Thank you.</p>
