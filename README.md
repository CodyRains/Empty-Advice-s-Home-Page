This is a home page for my music.

For my first CSS item, I used a responsive Navbar at the top of my page that adjusts with all screen sizes, and has a working hamburger button on mobile screens.

For my first JavaScript item, I made a contact form that allows the user to email my personal email address directly from my site. I used JavaScript to require 5 characters, an "@", and a "." to successfully send. I also used JS to require at least two characters for the subject to be vaild, and the message must have at least 10 characters. If a requirement isn't met, a message will pop up underneath the form saying that the field is invalid. The actual email function doesn't work yet because my site isn't live, but one of my mentors told me that the valid/invalid JavaScript would count towards passing.

For my second CSS item, I used Flexbox to change from a double column on large screens, to a single column on tablet and mobile screens on both my home page (in the about me/albums section) and in the actual albums page. You can go to it by clicking the albums link in my navbar, or by clicking on the link inside the text in the paragraph under albums on the home page.

For my second JavaScript item: I created a working show more/show less button under the albums section of my main page(index.html). If you click 'show more' a description of one of my songs pops up. If you hit 'show less' the description disappears.
